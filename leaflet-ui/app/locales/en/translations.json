		"phrase1": "This beta version of the Project and Programs Information Exchange System (PPIES) Open Map website is the output of a USAID technical assistance to NEDA called the Higher Education Solutions Network with Development Gateway as implementing partner under the AidData Center for Development Policy. The Project aimed to develop an online mapping tool which displays the distribution and impact of donor assistance to government programs and projects. It allows mapping or visualization of gaps that need to be addressed in future programming, particularly on how and where to focus future development interventions in the country.",
		"phrase2": "The Project started implementation in April 2016, and the beta version of the website was launched in September 2016. Parallel to this, in January 2016, the NEDA engaged the services of a consulting firm for the enhancement of the PPIES, which is the central online database system of NEDA on monitoring proposed and ongoing major projects and programs of the Philippine Government. The final version of this website is envisioned to be linked with the enhanced PPIES to serve as the latter system’s mapping tool.",
		"phrase3": "The beta version of the website shows information on proposed and ongoing major ODA- and locally-funded programs and projects of the Philippine Government as of year-end 2015, including those completed in 2015. The source of information were the government implementing agencies and bilateral and multilateral development partners of the Philippine Government. The information were gathered from the regular monitoring activities of the NEDA Monitoring and Evaluation Staff (for ongoing projects and programs) and the NEDA Public Investment Staff (for proposed projects and programs)."
